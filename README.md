 Project Introduction: Python-Based Student Management System
Managing academic records efficiently is crucial for both educational institutions and learners. 
This Python-based Student Management System offers a powerful and secure platform designed to streamline student data management through role-based access, user-friendly interaction, and insightful analytics.

🌟 Key Features:
🔐 Role-Based Login for Admins and Students, with secure credential handling
📋 Student Profile Management including real-time updates to personal data, grades, and extracurricular activities (ECA)
📊 Admin Dashboard for adding, modifying, and deleting student records, as well as generating data insights
📈 Interactive Visualizations using matplotlib for grade charts and subject-wise analytics
🧠 Data-Driven Insights including average grades, most active students in ECAs, and distribution of academic performance
🗂️ File-Based Persistence through structured .txt records (users, grades, ECAs, credentials) for easy data management without databases

Crafted using OOP principles, robust input validation, and modular design, this system not only simulates real-world school operations but also demonstrates strong command of core Python concepts.
Whether used for learning, a portfolio, or scaling into a larger application, this project provides a solid foundation for comprehensive student information systems.
